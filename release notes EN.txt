- FUNCTIONALITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

SkuFluegel gives wingpeople a visual indication of the status of whoever they are guiding.   
The to-be-guided player only needs to have the normal Sku addons installed for this to work.

The SkuFluegel addon does not need to be installed for the player that is to be guided.
The addon displays up to four small status panels with the following colored letters and meanings:      

      Gray - no information available at the moment      
      Green - this status applies  
      Yellow - this status partially applies (see below for I)      
      Red - this status is NOT applicable
      F - Follow (player is following someone)
      C - Casting (player is casting a spell)
      I - Interact (player is interacting with an NPC)
          As long as quest giver windows are open, the I will be yellow. When a quest is turned in, the I will turn green for 5 seconds.
      M - Mounted (player is mounted)
      L - Looting (player is looting)

      Example: 
         A green F means your partner is following someone (hopefully you *g*).
         A red F means that your partner is not currently following anyone.

   Sounds:
      In the case of status F, the addon provides audio notifications. When changing from green/red, the addon goes ding or dong, depending. :)
      With status I, the addon plays a short pling when it is green (quest being turned in).

   Target selection:
      You have to first select the target character the status panels should monitor. To do this, target them in the usual way and press CTRL + SHIFT + 1 to 4.
      After you've done this, the respective status panel (1-4) will appear with the name of the character you have selected and for which the status is currently displayed.
      You can switch to another character at any time. If you don't want to see any status anymore, just press CTRL + SHIFT + 1 to 4 without a target.

   Configuration:
      You can move the status panels around with the mouse and configure them in the Blizzard interface options (ESC > Interface > Addons > SkuFluegel).
      There you can, for example, enlarge/reduce them, dock them, or switch individual status values on and off.

- CHANGELOG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

   Version 5.7
      What's new:
         - CAUTION: Blind players need to use Sku r27.15 to have the new features working!
         - There is a new key bind CTRL + SHIFT + V to remotely set blind players on unfollow. 
         - It now is possible to set all blind players or a specific blind player on follow/unfollow. If you are targeting a blind player, then only that player will be set on follow/unfollow. If you are targeting nothing, or something else than one of the blind players (tracked targets 1-4), then all blind players will follow/unfollow.	
         - The status will now update instantly.
         - Fixed a bug with the C status (casting). Sometimes that status wasn't updated correctly. It still can happen, if the blind player is starting a cast and stopps that cast instantly.

      What's new:
         - There is now a tooltip with the meanings of the letters when hovering over the display.

         - The name of the current follow target is now displayed below the indicator.
